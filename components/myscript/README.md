# MyScriptJS

[MyScriptJS](http://myscript.github.io/MyScriptJS/) is a free and open-source JavaScript library providing the easiest way to use the [MyScript Cloud](https://dev.myscript.com/) handwriting recognition service in your app.

[MyScriptJS](http://myscript.github.io/MyScriptJS/) speeds up the development of handwriting interfaces with JavaScript, by abstracting and providing default implementations for the common tasks that need to be managed:

* **Ink management**: Store strokes and benefit from a built-in undo/redo system.
* **Ink rendering**: Attach a renderer to a HTML5 canvas to start capturing and displaying smooth strokes.
* **Call to the recognizer**: MyScriptJS manages requests to MyScript Cloud as well as API calls, using HTTP/REST or WebSocket protocols (new in Cloud 3.0).
* **All MyScript recognition types**: The object model of MyScriptJS supports the recognition of handwritten text, shapes, music notation and mathematical expressions.
* **Result tree parsing**: The recognition result tree is exposed and fully traversable.
* **Typesetting (coming soon)**: Replace ink with digital equivalent, whether it is text, music, shapes or mathematical expressions.
